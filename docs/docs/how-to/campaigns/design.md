# Design a Campaign
Each campaign is made up of a series of templates, each representing a given locale (language). After your campaign has been created, you can navigate to the `Design` tab to get started and create a template.

## Create Template
Selecting `Create Template` will open a modal with various options depending on the channel of the campaign, but all of them require selecting a locale. If you dont have any already, create one, otherwise pick the locale you are targeting from the list!

### Locales
A locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, region and any special variant. They can be anything from as broad a category as a language at large (`es` for Spanish) to as specific as a dialect (`en_PH` for English from the Philippines).

## Design
Once you have created a template you can begin designing it! Each channel that a campaign can be sent over has different editors that can be used to customize what you are sending.

### Email
You have by far the most customizeability when sending emails. You are able to adjust the entire design to be anything you would like. There are two different options for designing emails and the editor will vary based on your selection.

#### Visual

#### Code
If you select to code the email yourself, you are given a code editor window that you can use. This editor allows for many of the conveniences of modern code editors like code suggestions and collapsing. You are also able to import uploaded images directly. Handlebars templating can be used throughout to autopopulate data directly from the user.
