# Lists
Lists allow you to group sets of users together to target them for messages. There are two different kinds of lists:
- **Dynamic**: These lists generate themselves based on a set of criteria/rules that are set. After the initial list of users is generated, any users who fall into the criteria moving forward will find themselves added to the list.
- **Static**: These are lists that are fixed and do not change on their own. The subset of users within them comes from an uploaded CSV document.
